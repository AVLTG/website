            <p class="sec4">Outside of school, there are a lot of things I enjoy doing. I mainly enjoy playing video games. I play mainly single/multiplayer player rpg games like The Elder Scroll series, The Fallout series, the Dark Souls series (and Sekiro). I also enjoy a lot of indie games such as Stardew Valley, Starbound, Hollow Knight, and Blasphemous. There are a few competitive  multiplayer games that I enjoy too such as Counter Strike and League of Legends. <br>
            Beyond that, I also greatly enjoy soccer, both playing and watching. In terms of playing, I used to play in my cities rep team as a defender. In terms of watching, I am a big fan of the premier league and have been rooting for Manchester United since i was about 5. <br>
            I also used to play the guitar a lot, however, recently I have had literally no time to do so. I also did concert band for a little bit in high school.  </p>
